    "#### QSAR Pipeline for Ionic-Liquid Cytotoxicity\n",
    "\n",
    "This module implements a fully automated **Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR)** pipeline for predicting the cytotoxicity of ionic liquids using multiple curated CSV datasets. It supports both **regression (CC50 prediction)** and **binary toxicity classification**, and produces all required molecular fingerprints, physicochemical descriptors, metadata encodings, and trained machine-learning artifacts.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1 Architectural Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "  **1.1 Data Aggregation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically loads all cytotoxicity CSV files from\n",
    "  `data/cytotoxicity_ionic_liquids/csv_datasets/`\n",
    "* Adds `Family` labels based on the file names.\n",
    "* Standardizes numeric formats such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `\"1,5\"` → `1.5`\n",
    "  * `\"1–2\"` → mean of the range\n",
    "  * strings containing units, parentheses, or trailing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2 Molecular Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core structural representation is a **2048-bit Morgan Fingerprint (ECFP)** generated using RDKit:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Radius = 2\n",
    "* Vector length = 2048 bits (`fp_0` … `fp_2047`)\n",
    "* Automatic salt/pair stripping and SMILES normalization\n",
    "* Graceful zero-vector fallback if parsing fails\n",
    "\n",
    "This compact high-dimensional bit vector captures substructural features essential for SAR modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **1.3 Physicochemical Descriptors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each molecule also receives three RDKit-calculated descriptors:\n",

    "| **LogP_calc**  | Logarithm of octanol/water partition coefficient |\n",
    "| **TPSA_calc**  | Topological Polar Surface Area                   |\n",
    "\n",
    "These descriptors improve generalization by incorporating global physicochemical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **1.4 Metadata Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several experimental or biological categorical fields are factorized:\n",

    "* `Family_enc`\n",
    "* `Cell type_enc`\n",
    "* `Organism_enc`\n",
    "* `Full name of method_enc`\n",
    "\n",
    "These encode differences in assay conditions, cell types, and data source variability, which improves predictive robustness.\n",

    "  **1.5 Target Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two parallel machine learning targets are produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Regression target**\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "log_CC50 = log10(CC50_mM)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Default threshold: `1.0 mM` (configurable).\n",

    "  **2.1 Parsing Raw CC50/IC50/EC50 Data**\n",

    "* supports commas, parentheses, units, and mixed text\n",
    "* extracts numbers safely\n",
    "* averages numeric ranges (e.g., `\"1–3\"` → `2.0`)\n",
    "* converts invalid entries to `NaN`\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows missing both SMILES or potency values are removed.\n",

    "Cytotoxicity spans orders of magnitude. To normalize the distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "log_CC50 = log10(CC50_mM)\n",
    "```\n",
